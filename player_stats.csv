Collins is focused on becoming a positionless big man who can handle the ball, create shots, and switch onto guards defensively. However, his consistency in shooting and ability to stay healthy will determine his overall impact."

Standing at 6'10"", he poses a nightmare matchup for defenders with his combination of size and shooting touch. While primarily a perimeter player, Porter Jr. is extremely efficient near the basket, making 80.3% of his attempts from within three feet. His offensive game could benefit from more inside play, particularly during non-Jokić minutes, to diversify his scoring and keep defenses guessing. However, Porter Jr. can sometimes be a defensive liability due to his laziness, which affects his overall impact on the game. Health concerns may limit his interior play, but his ability to cut towards the rim and use his size effectively can make him a more versatile and dangerous scorer."

He can play as a small forward or a small-ball power forward. Bey's offensive game includes three-point shooting, particularly effective from the corners, and improved interior scoring, finishing 57% of his shots at the rim. However, his inconsistent three-point shooting, especially from above the break, has been a challenge. Defensively, Bey struggles with footspeed and offers limited rim protection and rebounding, issues exacerbated when paired with similarly skilled players. His role as a secondary creator and physical driver suits bench units better, allowing him to exploit mismatches and minimize defensive liabilities."

He excels at finishing around the basket, boasting a high dunk rate and impressive efficiency. Bryant is also a solid shot-blocker, using his length and instincts to defend the rim. However, his defensive impact is inconsistent, as he struggles with protecting the rim effectively. Offensively, Bryant's ability to space the floor and punish mismatches makes him a versatile threat. He can provide a scoring boost for bench units and has the potential to complement other key players with his inside presence and pick-and-pop abilities."
