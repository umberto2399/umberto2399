Composed by these files:

1. req.txt --> contains all the needed libraries to run the app
2. player_stats.csv --> contains all the stats of individual NBA players for the season 2022-2023 (the column playing_style is still a work in progress)
3. GitHub_app.py --> contains the streamlit app script of the prototype. With that you can visualize the data, add a description for the playing_style column and store the info into the df and test the trade advisor (gpt 4o)
